    <h2>
      Hello, I'm Nathan McEntee. I'm a musician and engineer from San Diego, California, who primarily plays drums and bass, as well as a little bit of guitar. I'm seeking
      to join a local band where I can hone my skills and earn some cash on the side while studying to become an engineer. I have 5-years of experience in
      performing music, from being in a 4-person rock band, to an 18-person jazz ensemble, to a 60-person symphony. My skills are mainly bass, drums, and guitar.
      As an engineer, I'm primarily experienced in HTML, as well as some JavaScript and CSS. I can also use Excel.

        Oakcrest is when I first learned how to play drumset. In the two years of me being in the Oakcrest band, the band received two gold medals for 
        performing at music festivals. I played drumset for the majority of the songs in these concerts. At Oakcrest, I joined my first jazz band which
        is where I learned how to play drumest. While being in this band, I played in my town's local holiday festival twice, which gave me experience in
        marching band. While at Oakcrest, I played many difficult songs, such as Aggressivo, Jungle Dance, Darklands March, which earned us 2 gold medals.

        In my time at School of Rock I learned how to play bass. I've only been playing bass since February 2024. I have already become one of the best bassists
        in the School, despite the fact that multiple of them have been playing bass for years. I have gotten into the house band, which means that I am 
        a part of some of the best musicians in the entirety of my School of Rock.

        My most recent year at SDA were by far the time that I not only improved the most, but also when I began to consider myself as a good percussionist.
        I've played some incredibly difficult songs, such as Curtain Call, New York: 1927, Caravan, With Wind and Water, Sunchasers, Mambo, The Symphonic
        Gershwin, Les Miserables, Rapture, and How to Train Your Dragon. During this time, I learned how to play mallet percussion, which I never new before.
        With this newfound talent I've learned how to play songs on mallets, such as New York: 1927 and Les Miserables and with jazz band songs, such as
        Stars and Stripes Forever and Greensleeves. I also learned multiple difficult songs for jazz band including, Summertime, Critical Mass, Greensleeves,
        Hallelujah I Love Her So, Feeling Good. In the middle of this school year, I also did a marching performance for my home town in the winter of this
        year where I did marching mallet percussion which was incredibly difficult because I had to have high levels of precision while walking in rhythm.
        Finally, by far the most impressive part of this year was my performance in Carnegie Hall.. While performing in Carnegie Hall, I played Curtain Call, 
        New York: 1927, Hoe Down, The Symphonic Gershwin, and Mambo. It is the most impressive part of my entire musical career and I was greatly honored to 
        take part in it.
